            "Fleet PC is a small service I created for custom PC builds. My biggest problem with big companies that sell PCs is that you never know where your money is going. I wanted to create a service that showed customers exactly how their PC expenses were divided. Although I currently use this for extended friends and family, I may look into establishing a sole proprietorship in the future.",
