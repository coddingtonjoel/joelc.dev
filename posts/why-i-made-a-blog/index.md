title: Why I Made a Blog

This last April, I took the liberty in creating my own portfolio website. I thought it would be a very beneficial idea because I was looking to seriously apply for internships this fall, looking ahead to Summer 2021. Although I'm just a sophomore in college, I know all the dedication and time I've put into studying web development on my own would eventually pay off and that it would definitely be in my favor to have a public place to display my skills. So that's it. That's why I made a blog. Simple enough, right?

So here's a little bit about me: I'm currently a sophomore at Biola University, and I've always been interested in technology my whole life. My attention has been specifically focused towards user interfaces and I finally began to start learning web development at the end of last year. Fast forward to now, September 2020, and I've gained lots of skills along the way like React and Gatsby. I'm honestly proud that I even have motivation to just sit down and learn through Udemy courses and take notes rather than do other things like play video games. I'm generally very future-oriented, so I look forward wondering what kinds of amazing things I'll be able to accomplish as I grow as a developer, and the amazing places I might be given the opportunity to work for. I first began seriously programming in the spring of 2019 where I learned C++ on my own, and have been learning non-stop ever since. Although I avoided learning web programing for a while (that's a story for a different post), I knew that I liked using logic through programming, but wasn't too interested in processing data or working with databases-- I always liked the user interface aspect of coding, and I knew it was something I wanted to persue.

My main reason for writing this post is just letting you know there is more to come. I know that I'm just writing a random blog post on my nearly non-existent website, but that's the point. If I'm going to start somewhere, it may as well be here.
